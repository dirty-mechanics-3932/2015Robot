 * Grabs the can at "low can height", so about 1/4 way up, 
 * raises it up high enough for the tote tabs to grab it and have it hang
 * opens the arms a bit so we can slide the arms down to the bottom of the
 * can and grab it again (close arms fully) and then raises the can
 * all the way to the top of the elevator so it can stack on top of
 * all of the totes.
