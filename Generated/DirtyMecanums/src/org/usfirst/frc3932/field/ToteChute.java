 * >b>Each TOTE CHUTE opening is 1 ft. 3.25 in. tall by 1 ft. 6.5 in. wide</b>, 
 * with the bottom of the opening located 1 ft. 6.5 in. above the carpet.
 * The TOTE CHUTE is installed behind the TOTE CHUTE opening 
 * (i.e. on the outside of the FIELD) and consists of an 2 ft. 6 in. long
 * ramp of HDPE, at a 22 degree incline, with a upper edge that is 2 ft. 6.625 in. 
 * from the floor. The ramp is covered with a shield of clear polycarbonate. A clear polycarbonate CHUTE DOOR is installed over the TOTE CHUTE opening and prevents a TOTE in the TOTE CHUTE from sliding out into the playing FIELD. Once a TOTE is loaded in to the TOTE CHUTE, the CHUTE DOOR can be opened using a handle located on either side of the CHUTE DOOR. This allows a TOTE loaded in the TOTE CHUTE to slide onto the FIELD.
